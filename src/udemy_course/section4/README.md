# Section 4: Java tutorial: Expressions, Statements, Code blocks, Methods and more
In this section I got introduce to Java basics: declaration statements, expressions and primitive data types.

## Keywords and expressions:
- java keywords: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_keywords
- expressions:
int `score = 100`;
if (`score > 99`) {
    System.out.println(`"You got the high score!"`);
    `score = 0`;
}

## Statements, Whitespace and Identation:
- A statement is the entire line. It ends with semiconlon. Can be on multiple line.
- More than one statement can be put on one line.
- Whitespace between variables and operators.
- Multiple whitespaces will get removed by the compiler.
- Identation in IntelliJ: Code > Reformat code
