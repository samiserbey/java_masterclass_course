# Section 6: OOP Part 1 - Classes, Constructors and Inheritance
- classes are regular data type on steroids

## Classes
- instance variables/fields should be private `private double firstNumber;`
- getters, setters

## Constructors
- constructors can be overloaded (can have more than 1 constructor)
- it is possible to call one construct from another constructor `this(x, y, z);`
- must be first in constructor body
- general rule of thumb: only assign values to fields in the constructor
