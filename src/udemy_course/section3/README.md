1. Declaration Statement
2. Expressions
3. Primitive data types:
- byte (8 bits)
- short (16 bits)
- int (32 bits) => always use integer unless you got a really good reason to not do that
- long


- float (32 bits)
- double (64 bits) => double is faster so its highly recommend to use it over float


- char (16 bits / 2 bytes) => it stores unicode characters
- boolean

4. Casting in Java: (short) (byte)
5. float/double both not great for precise calculations, we should use BigDecimal.
6. string data type is not a primitive type. It's actually a class. Strings are immutable. New string get created each time we modify its value.
7. Should use StringBuffer to append strings. This is more efficient.
8. Java operators: + - * / % = == != > < <= >= && || & |
9. Operands => 5 * myValue (5 is an operand, myValue is an operand)
10. Expressions => 5 * myValue is an expression
11. if then statement => always use code blocks
